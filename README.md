# SoSiffreScheduler
An attempt to automate the process of making schedules for salesteams, which my poor manager at H&M had to do by hand. This is actually a specific case of the Nurse Scheduling Problem.

Well I've been completely neglecting this project for a looooong time, and will likely continue to do so for the near future.

well basically it works - unless it doesn't.
And one of the times it doesn't work is when a member of the salesteam with few   hours is free and in the list before a member of the salesteam with many hours. 
The solution to this would probably be to sort the salesteam by hours.

So it seems to work. Have yet to test in a bunch of weird cases. Gunna go work on a GUI.
