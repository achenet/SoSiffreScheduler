helps make schedule

current update - as of 29 June 2019
well basically it works - unless it doesn't.
And one of the times it doesn't work is when a member of the salesteam with few   hours is free and in the list before a member of the salesteam with many hours. 
The solution to this would probably be to sort the salesteam by hours.
